# 🔋 Smart MPPT for Photovoltaic Systems using AI (Neural Networks + Reinforcement Learning)

This project explores intelligent Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) for solar photovoltaic (PV) systems using Artificial Intelligence techniques. We combine Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, and TinyML deployment to create an adaptive, high-efficiency MPPT controller that outperforms traditional methods.
🚀 Features

    🧠 Neural Network-based MPPT: Trained on synthetic and real-world PV data to model panel behavior.

    🎯 Reinforcement Learning with OpenAI Gymnasium: Custom environment simulates PV panel dynamics, allowing an RL agent (PPO/DQN) to learn optimal voltage/current adjustments.

    ⚙️ Traditional vs AI Comparison: Includes benchmarks with P&O, INC, and fuzzy logic controllers.

    📉 Power vs Time Performance Chart: Evaluate tracking efficiency over variable irradiance and temperature.

    💾 TinyML Deployment: Convert trained models to TensorFlow Lite and deploy on Arduino or ESP32 microcontrollers.

    📊 Simulation Tools: Visualize and debug with Python tools (Matplotlib, Plotly, Pandas).
